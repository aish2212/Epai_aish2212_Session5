# Assignment: EPAi Session 5, Functional Parameters

# Objective

Write a function which gives out average run time per call, such that it's definition is:
- def time_it(fn,Â *args, repetitons= 1, **kwargs): your code comes here.

We should be able to call it like this:
- time_it(print, 1, 2, 3, sep='-', end= ' ***\n'. repetitons=5)
- time_it(squared_power_list, 2, start=0, end=5, repetitons=5) #2 is the number you are calculating power of, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
- time_it(polygon_area, 15, sides = 3, repetitons=10) # 15 is the side length. This polygon supports area calculations of upto a hexagon
- time_it(temp_converter, 100, temp_given_in = 'f', repetitons=100) # 100 is the base temperature given to be converted
- time_it(speed_converter, 100, dist='km', time='min', repetitons=200) #dist can be km/m/ft/yrd, time can be ms/s/m/hr/day, speed given by user is in kmph

## Functions
# time_it
- This function provides the average run time per call.
- The input to the function are
  - function to be called
  - arguments of the function
  - Number of repetations of function called.

# squared_power_list
- This function provides the list of squared number.
- The input is the number you are calculating power of.
- For example if the number = 2, the squared list is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,...
- The other user inputs are start and end value of the list to be returned.

# polygon_area
- This function calculates the area of a polygon 
- Number of sides possible is of range 3 to 6
- The user input are:
   - Length of the side (length)
   - Number of sides (sides)
- Area of the polygon = (sides * length**2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / sides))

# temp_converter
- This is the temperature converter which converts the temperature given by the user from either Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Fahrenheit depending on the input from user.
- The input given by the user involves,
  - temperature value
  - temp given in whether 'f' or 'c'
- Fahrenheit to Celsius --> temp = (temp-32) * 5/9
- Celsius to Fahrenheit --> temp = (temp*(9/5))+32

# speed_converter
- This function calculates the area of a polygon maximum of sides = 6.
- The user input are:
   - Length of the side
   - Number of sides
